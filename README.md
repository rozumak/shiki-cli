# Shikicli

A simple CLI app that applies syntax highlighting to a file using [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki). It is packaged as a standalone executable and can be used without Node.js or npm.

## Getting Started

To install and use Shikicli, you can download the executable for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/rozumak/shiki-cli/releases/latest) on GitHub. Make sure to give it executable permissions:

```bash
# Example for macOS
curl -sLO https://github.com/rozumak/shiki-cli/releases/latest/download/shikicli-macos-x64
chmod +x shikicli-macos-x64
mv shikicli-macos-x64 shikicli
```

Now you can use it to apply syntax highlighting to a file:

```bash
# Highlight a file using default options
./shikicli --input example.js --output example.html --language javascript

# Highlight a file using a specific theme
./shikicli -i example.js -o example.html -l js -t nord
```

Only the default languages and themes that are bundled with the shiki library can be used.

## Usage

```
shikicli --input [input file path] --output [output file path] --language [input file language] [--theme [shiki theme]]
```

## Options
